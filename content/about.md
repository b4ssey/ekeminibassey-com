Ekemini works as a Product Security Engineer at Just Eat Takeaway.com in London. He doesn’t match the usual hacker stereotype. His Nigerian accent sometimes turns 'pear' into 'pierre,' which confuses his team almost as much as his usual reply to "How are you?"—"I'm surviving."

Hailing from the "Giants of Africa," Ekemini switched from building software to breaking it, mostly to make up for the insecure code he wrote earlier in his career. His curiosity for taking things apart started young: he became an engineer because he kept breaking (and frantically fixing) his family’s Windows XP desktop in the 2000s.

Outside of work, he is a Sound Engineer and plays football with a style similar to Kai Havertz—clumsy but effective—though his energy runs out precisely at the 6km mark. When he’s not on the pitch, he is likely tinkering with his homelab or inefficiently vibe-coding.
